# Lodo
Lodo is a web based double entry accounting application, built on the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework.
It is open source, released under AGPLv3.

## Project status
We're currently finishing up the first milestone/deliverable. A second development cycle is required to add some essential features before we consider it ready for experimental use, a schedule for this phase is still TBD.

## Features
The initial release aims to deliver these features:

  * Chart of accounts, with abstract ledger support which should cover AR, AP and salary ledgers
  * General ledger
  * Orders and billing
  * Support for multiple users and tenants. Seems like proper access control didn't make it into this version

### Upcoming features
Preliminary feature list for the next milestone:

  * Reporting
  * Finish up user administration and access control
  * Salaries
  * A test suite
