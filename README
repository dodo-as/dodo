= Lodo
Lodo is a web based double entry accounting application, built on the Ruby&nbsp;on&nbsp;Rails[http://rubyonrails.org/] framework.
It is open source, released under AGPLv3.

== Project status
We're currently finishing up the first milestone/deliverable. A second development cycle is required to add some essential features before we consider it ready for experimental use, a schedule for this phase is still TBD.

== Features
The initial release aims to deliver these features:
  * Chart of accounts, with abstract ledger support which should cover AR, AP and salary ledgers
  * General ledger
  * Orders and billing
  * Support for multiple users and tenants. Seems like proper access control didn't make it into this version

=== Upcoming features
Preliminary feature list for the next milestone:
  * Reporting
  * Finish up user administration and access control
  * Salaries
  * A test suite

== Community
  * Redmine: https://projects.freecode.no/projects/show/lodo-ng
    * I don't think the above is public. We might move issue tracking to lighthouse, trac.lodo.no or somewhere else..?
